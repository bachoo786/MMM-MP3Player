Still needing to do:<br>
    1) stylus animation, click play - stylus moves over record, record spins. click pause or stop, stylus moves back to starting position,        record stops spinning. (??? stylus animation between songs. ???)<br>
  
    3) shuffle list option, click shuffle button would auto-play. include stylus animation.<br>
    4) title to scroll during play.<br>
