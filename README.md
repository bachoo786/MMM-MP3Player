Still needing to do:
    1) stylus animation, click play - stylus moves over record, record spins. click pause or stop, stylus moves back to starting position,        record stops spinning. (??? stylus animation between songs. ???) 
    2) continuous play through list. 
    3) shuffle list option, click shuffle button would auto-play. including stylus animation 
    4) title to scroll during play. 
    5) pre load first song, so the title shows and can click play to start playing song.
